# Chess_GameDev
Contains all the files for Game Development- Chess. 

I made this Chess models and boards 3 years back. Now I take this challenge on building a game of Chess using those models. Date: 24-03-2021

NOTES:

1. All mathematical calculations and algorithms will be developed by myself as much as possible.
2. Try to complete in **2 weeks** maximum.
3.  Upload on **Itch.io** after the game is completed adding to the **PortFolio**.
